### Architecture
### Prerequisites

### Spinning up application (Docker)
### Committing your contribution
#### 1. Write tests then code
Writing the unit tests first will help you think through your problem and how to solve it better.

#### 2.  Follow the code style
If you don't you won't be able to push anyway :)

#### 3. Code working and all tests passing? Integration Tests
Write new integration tests or extend the existing ones to accommodate your work.
 
#### 4. All tests green? Refactoring time!
Make sure you are proud of your work:
* Look for commented out code and get rid of it
* Add comments in complex areas (can you make it simpler?)
* Update documentation when needed, specially this very same document here.

#### 5. Repeat
